### Project Implementation
- Description: The report, Implementation files and source code for the ALU Super project.
- Code: [Link to Project Implementation](https://github.com/lelnazrezaeel/Computer-Aided-Digital-Design-IUST/tree/main/Project)

The ALU works as follows:
- It receives a 43-bit instruction with the following format:
  - 3 bits for the first operator.
  - 3 bits for the second operator.
  - 3 bits for the third operator.
  - 8 bits for the first number.
  - 8 bits for the second number.
  - 8 bits for the third number.
  - 8 bits for the fourth number.
- All numbers are integers (positive or negative).
- The operators are as follows:
  - 000: Addition.
  - 001: Subtraction.
  - 010: Multiplication.
  - 011: Division.
  - 100: Exponentiation.
  - 101: Logarithm.
  - 110: Square root.
